<div style="color: blue; font-style: italic"><h1>Bud Spencer</h1></div>

<div class="up"><p>Carlo Pedersoli (31 October 1929 – 27 June 2016), known professionally as Bud Spencer, was an Italian
    actor,
    professional swimmer and water polo player. He was known for action-comedy and Spaghetti Western roles with his
    long-time film partner Terence Hill. The duo "garnered world acclaim and attracted millions to theater seats".
    Spencer and Hill appeared in, produced and directed over 20 films together.</p>

<div class="bottom"><h2>Acting career</h2>

    <p>Pedersoli's first film role was in Quel fantasma di mio marito, an Italian comedy short released in 1950. In 1951
        he played a member of the Praetorian Guard in Quo Vadis, an epic film shot in Italy made by MGM and directed by
        Mervyn LeRoy. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Spencer appeared playing minor parts in Italian including Mario
        Monicelli's movie A Hero of Our Times, with Alberto Sordi and the 1954 war film Human Torpedoes with Raf
        Vallone.

        In 1960, after the Summer Olympic games, Pedersoli married Maria Amato, daughter of Italian film producer
        Giuseppe
        Amato. He signed a contract with RCA Records to write lyrics for singers such as Ornella Vanoni and Nico Fidenco
        and soundtracks. In the following years, his son Giuseppe was born (1961), followed by Cristiana (1962), his
        contract with RCA expired and his father-in-law died (1964). Pedersoli became a producer of documentaries for
        the
        national public broadcasting company RAI.

        In 1967, film director Giuseppe Colizzi offered him a role in God Forgives... I Don't!. On the set Pedersoli met
        Mario Girotti (Terence Hill). Although Pedersoli had met Girotti before on the set of Hannibal in 1959, this was
        the
        moment they went on to become a film duo. The film director asked the two actors to change their names, deeming
        them
        to be too Italian-sounding for a Western movie: Pedersoli chose Bud Spencer, with Bud inspired by Budweiser beer
        and
        Spencer by the actor Spencer Tracy.

        While Hill's characters were agile and youthful, Spencer always played the "phlegmatic, grumpy strong-arm man
        with a
        blessed, naive child's laughter and a golden heart". Overall, Hill and Spencer worked together on 18 films,
        including (using their most common U.S. titles) the Spaghetti Westerns They Call Me Trinity (1970) and its
        sequel,
        Trinity Is Still My Name (1971). Their last teaming, Troublemakers (1994), was also in this genre.

        Many of these have alternative titles, depending upon the country and distributor. Some have longer Italian
        versions
        that were edited for their release abroad. These films gathered popularity for both actors, especially
        throughout
        much of Europe and parts of Asia and South America. Because of the duo's huge popularity, many producers wanted
        to
        exploit their likeness with visually similar duos. Most notable were Paul L. Smith (adopted name Adam Eden in
        later
        years, sometimes credited Anam Eden) and Michael Coby (real name Antonio Cantafora) with at least 6 movies in
        Bud &
        Terence-fashion from 1973 to 1977, and István Bujtor with 6 movies in Piedone-fashion from 1981 to 2008.

        In the Italian versions of his films, Spencer was generally dubbed by actor Glauco Onorato due to his thick
        Naples
        accent, although he was voiced by Sergio Fiorentini in Troublemakers, To the Limit (1997) and the Extralarge
        series (1991–93). For English dubs, Spencer was usually voiced by Robert Sommer, Edward Mannix or Richard
        McNamara, although he occasionally provided his own voice.

        Spencer wrote the complete or partial screenplay for some of his movies. His feature film career slowed down
        after
        1983, shifting more toward television. In the 1990s, he acted in the television action-drama Extralarge. His
        autobiography was published in 2011. In addition, Spencer also published a recipe book including his favorite
        dishes.</p>
